# Session 2 - Fundamental Concepts

## Role of Visualization and Models

### Visualization
- Get easier understanding than analytics models
- Communicate/explain the results in an easier way
- Requires minimal training

### But is it okay to just depend on visualization? 
## Obviously no, but why?
Visualization at most show the relationship between 3 variables, preferably 2.

Given that we are required to see what affects the sales of Amazon, there are definitely more than 3 variables, including price, shipping fee, consumer reviews, discount rate, return policy, competitors and etc.  
Thus, it is impossible to visualize all of these variables in our pathetic 3 dimensional space. :(
This is where analytics models come into play.
